            In indoor aquaculture, fish are raised in water units constructed
            using simple plastic containers, aquariums, fish tanks, or tubs
            filled with tap water. This method is an excellent way to create an
            indoor fish farm. The best part of indoor farming is its
            scalability; it can be done on any scale, large or small, depending
            on the size of your available space.
